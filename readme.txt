Pythoneas is a map editing program that allows for the use of photos in the form of .gif files, reading .txt files, and implementing a Weather Underground API.

Any photos you wish to use must be manually placed in the termProject folder as a .gif file.

No outside dictionaries or files are required aside from ones already in the directory that were entered by other users for the purpose of map-making.

Do not tamper with users.txt, or any other .txt files, or remove any existing files in this directory as they contain important data about maps previously made by other users.

The only module that must be installed is urllib3 which can be done by entering “pip install urllib3” into your terminal.

Besides that all of the graphics, mapping capabilities, and other data are accounted for in the Pythoneas.py file (and Python3).

Once you have installed urllib3 you may open Pythoneas.py, and run the program.

Enjoy!
