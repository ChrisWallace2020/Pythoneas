Chris Wallace
Pythoneas

-Now the program is meant for the creation and sharing of maps, rather than the use of a CMU map
-There is a front end with multiple splash screens, for browsing other maps as well as editing maps
-All data, nodes, edges, weights, info about nodes/edges/etc. will be user entered
-In conclusion, Pythoneas is now more broad in scope and allows for user creation
