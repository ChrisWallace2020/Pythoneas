Pythoneas uses user made maps to represent areas they wish to traverse, by importing a user-specified image and drawing a relevant graph on top. The user clicks where they are, and where they wish to go, and Pythoneas uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate 3 separate paths based on 3 weighting priorities: distance, distance and weather, distance and accessibility. It weights based on the users preference for how they wish to reach their destination. The user can either make their own map from scratch or edit an existing one. When the user saves a map, it saves only their contributions to an existing map, leaving the original copy in tact for the creator of the original map that the user decided to edit.

Pythoneas uses Google Maps and Apple Maps very intuitive design of drawing the path over the map to allow for an easy to interpret result. Pythoneas differs in that it allows for user creation, so that the maps made are more detailed and specific, and more relevant to a given user. It also takes user preference into account, as it is meant primarily for those who commute on foot, so weather and stairs are very relevant when deciding how to reach a destination.

Most feedback from early tests were related to the interface. To make the user experience when editing a map more enjoyable and intuitive, more buttons were added, as well as only displaying context-dependent directions; meaning that you will always know what “mode” you are in, how to operate within that mode, and how to switch to other modes, with as little text and distraction as possible. The browse screen is simply a list with double clicking ability to allow for a standard file directory navigation experience.

Every design feature of Pythoneas is intentional and meaningful, and it was all made with efficiency and simplicity in mind.
